{"0":"Love these. Was looking for converses and these were half the price and so unique I've never seen clear shoes like these; they fit great. The plastic takes a little getting used to but the style is so worth it.","1":"The shoes are very cute, but after the 2nd day of wearing them the tongue started ripping. After the 3rd day of wearing them the plastic on the side ripped. They could have ripped bc I was wearing them to work and I do a lot of walking at work. If you\u2019re going to buy these I don\u2019t recommend wearing them on days where you will do a lot of walking or they might rip","2":"Good quality","3":"Great","4":"I have been using this product for last 3 years and I really love this product.","5":"This product is very long lasting. I really recommend it to every one.","6":"Very good product and pretty durable.","7":"I don't know how this product has such good reviews. Mine broke after 1 week of use. I don't recommend it.","8":"Nice product and works everytime. I have been using it for last 4 years and no complaints.","9":"I don't like this device at all. It's nothing like what is shown in the advertisement.","10":"Pretty decent product. Good for the price."}
